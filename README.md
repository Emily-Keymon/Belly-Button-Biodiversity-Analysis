# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis
The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present interactive visualizations of belly button biodiversity data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in JSON format, D3 was used to import and process the data, while Plotly was used to generate the required visualizations.

## Tasks
### Data Extraction
1.  Used D3 library to read in samples.json file.
2.  Filtered the data for the object with the desired sample number.
3.  Used D3 to select the panel with id of `#sample-metadata`.
4.  Cleared any existing metadata.
5.  Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata.

### Create Visualizations 
1.  Built bubble chart.
2.  Plotted bubble chart.
3.  Built horizontal bar chart.
4.  Plotted horizontal bar chart.

###
1.  Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
2.  Selected a reference to the dropdown select element.
3.  Used the list of sample names to populate the select options.
4.  Used the first sample from the list to build the initial plots.
5.  


5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
